SolutionGenerator
Initialization:

Define a set of initial solutions.
Initialize the language model (e.g., GPT-4).
Define a dynamic utility function to evaluate solutions.
Solution Generation with Language Model:

Generate initial solutions using the language model.
Input: Problem statement, hints, and context.
Output: Initial solutions.
Iterative Improvement:

Iteratively improve each solution using the language model.
Input: Each initial solution.
Output: Improved solutions.
Parallel Processing:

Use multiprocessing to parallelly improve multiple solutions.
Input: Set of initial solutions.
Output: Set of improved solutions.
Selection of Best Solution:

Evaluate all improved solutions using the dynamic utility function.
Select the solution with the highest utility score.
Error Handling and Memory Management:

Implement error handling during solution generation and improvement.
Perform garbage collection to manage memory efficiently.
Main Function:

Tie all components together in a main function.
Input: User-defined problem statement and context.
Output: Best possible solution based on the dynamic utility function.
Implementation Steps:
Step 1: Define initial solutions and the problem context.
Step 2: Generate solutions using generate_solution_with_language_model.
Step 3: Apply iterative_improvement to each solution.
Step 4: Use parallel_solution_generation for multiprocessing.
Step 5: Evaluate and select the best solution using the utility function.
Step 6: Implement error handling and optimize memory usage.
Step 7: Execute the main function to obtain the best solution.
