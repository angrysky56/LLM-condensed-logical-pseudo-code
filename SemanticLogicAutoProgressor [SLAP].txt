SemanticLogicAutoProgressor [SLAP]:
  MetaFramework:
    Vocabulary:
      Advancement: "Overall progress or development"
      Truth: "Inherent value or foundational principles"
      Scrutiny: "Examination of flaws"
      Improvement: "Enhancements made over time"
      Weights:
        alpha: "Weight for the importance of Scrutiny"
        beta: "Weight for the importance of Improvement"
    Definitions:
      Advancement: "Truth + (alpha * Scrutiny) + (beta * Improvement)"
      Truth: "Base value representing initial hypotheses or principles"
      Scrutiny: "Measure of identification of weaknesses or gaps"
      Improvement: "Measure of changes made based on scrutiny"
    FactTypes:
      InitialAssessment: "Apply Advancement formula to evaluate the current state"
      IterativeRefinement: "Apply Advancement formula and update its components"
      ScrutinyAndFeedback: "Continuously scrutinize and use feedback for refinement"
      Reevaluation: "Periodically return to InitialAssessment for new evaluation"
    BusinessRules:
      Rule1: "Advancement formula must be applied before any changes to the project or theory"
      Rule2: "The sum of weights alpha and beta must be equal to 1"
      Rule3: "Reevaluation must occur at defined intervals"
    Constraints:
      Constraint1: "The project or theory must be well-defined"
      Constraint2: "Flaws must be measurable and identifiable"
      Constraint3: "Improvements must be quantifiable"
    Processes:
      EvaluationProcess: "Sequential steps to apply the Advancement formula"
      RefinementProcess: "Sequential steps to refine based on Scrutiny and Improvement"
      FeedbackProcess: "Sequential steps to collect and analyze feedback"
      ReevaluationProcess: "Sequential steps to periodically reassess the project or theory"
  Formula: "C(R(F(S(D(RB(M(SF)))))))"
  Components:
    C:
      Definition: "The process of forming a concept"
      LogicalFlow: "Start with Conceptualization (C)"
    R:
      Definition: "The act of depicting or symbolizing a concept"
      LogicalFlow: "Move to Representation (R)"
    F:
      Definition: "Statements considered to be true within the system"
      LogicalFlow: "Identify Facts (F)"
    S:
      Definition: "Critical examination or analysis"
      LogicalFlow: "Apply Scrutiny (S)"
    D:
      Definition: "The process of deriving new facts from existing ones"
      LogicalFlow: "Perform Derivation (D)"
    RB:
      Definition: "Approach based on predefined rules"
      LogicalFlow: "Utilize Rule-Based Approach (RB)"
    M:
      Definition: "A structured representation of the system"
      LogicalFlow: "Create or Update Model (M)"
    SF:
      Definition: "Formalization of semantics in the system"
      LogicalFlow: "End with Semantic Formalization (SF)"
