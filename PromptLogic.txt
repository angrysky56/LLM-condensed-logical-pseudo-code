Prompt Optimization with Logic-Driven GA and DE

### Pseudo-Code for EvoPrompt Optimization with Logic-Driven GA and DE

#### Common Initialization (Init)
```pseudo
Init:
  Population = GenerateInitialPrompts()
  EvaluateFitness(Population)
```

#### Genetic Algorithm (GA) Approach
```pseudo
GA_Optimization:
  WHILE NOT TerminationCondition() DO
    Selected = SelectPrompts(Population, LogicBasedCriteria)
    Offspring = Crossover(Selected, LogicalCombination)
    Mutated = Mutate(Offspring, ContextualAlteration)
    Population = Replace(Population, Mutated)
    EvaluateFitness(Population)
  END WHILE
  Return BestPrompt(Population)
```

#### Differential Evolution (DE) Approach
```pseudo
DE_Optimization:
  WHILE NOT TerminationCondition() DO
    FOR EACH prompt IN Population DO
      Mutant = MutatePrompt(prompt, LogicalAlteration)
      Trial = Crossover(prompt, Mutant)
      IF Fitness(Trial) > Fitness(prompt) THEN
        Replace(prompt, Trial)
      END IF
    END FOR
    EvaluateFitness(Population)
  END WHILE
  Return BestPrompt(Population)
```

#### Supporting Functions
```pseudo
GenerateInitialPrompts: Create initial set of prompts using task-specific logic
EvaluateFitness: Assess each prompt based on effectiveness and logic alignment
SelectPrompts: Choose prompts for crossover based on performance and diversity
Crossover: Combine elements of prompts while maintaining logical coherence
Mutate: Introduce logical changes to prompts to explore new possibilities
Replace: Update population with new or mutated prompts
TerminationCondition: Check if the optimization goal is met or max iterations reached
BestPrompt: Select the prompt with the highest fitness score
```
